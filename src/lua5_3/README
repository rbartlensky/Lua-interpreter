  Lua 5.3 yacc grammar
================================================================================

This is an adaption of Lua's 5.3 grammar to Yacc. As well as several minor
changes, there are two major changes. First, Lua's operator precedences are
directly encoded in this grammar's rules (so there are several rules called
exp[1-12]). Second, the inherent ambiguity in Lua's grammar (between function
calls and statements) leads to 1 shift/reduce and 1 reduce/reduce conflict.
Yacc's default disambiguation rules are used to resolve this ambiguity in favour
of function calls.

Note that the included lexer has one limitation: it cannot match arbitrary
numbers of "="s in multi-line comments (due to an inherent limitation of regular
expression). It therefore matches a predetermined number of "="s -- currently 5.
This means that while "[==[...]==]" works, "[======[...]======]" does not work.
This can, of course, be extended to a larger number, albeit at the cost of an
ever-growing regular expression.
